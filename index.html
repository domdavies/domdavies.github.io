        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> Hi, im dom, i m currently studying a Computer Games Development course at Staffordshire University-In my first year.
           I came to this university after a 2 year break from college in 2017/2018-to do my foundation year. I chose the University, because it is the best in the country for computer games students that are wanting to get a career in the gaming industry, and i am enjoying every minute of my time here. <p>
            
        <p> I have been passionate about getting a job within the gaming industry for quite some years now, and took the leap to enable me to fullfill my dream, to develop games alongside proffesional developers already in the industry. I aspire to one day work for one of the biggest gaming companies that i support-Treyarch, the developers of one of my favourate gaming franchises-Black ops.</p>
        
        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>At my University i am currently working to replicate a game called pacman-one of the greatist 8bit arcade games, that people still play today-using the c++ language, alongside with Visual Studio coding software. Not only do i want to replicate the game itself, but i want to see if i can develop my skills further, and see if i can adapt the game, to add in additional features.</p>
